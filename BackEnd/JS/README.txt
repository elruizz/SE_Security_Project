first i ran this command:

sudo npm install -g node-gyp

then I went and ran this command *I know it looks wierd but it works

sudo npm install @pokusew/pcsclite --save

after it gets all set up I just copied and pasted the reader code in a file and ran it using 

node reader.js 

and thats where it sits.
